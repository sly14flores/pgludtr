Work Hour Computation Algorithm

To clear timelog set it to 00:00:00
Any other value will be evaluated for example 00:00:01

Has value means not equal to 00:00:00

CASE 1: wholeday
morning timein has value
morning timeout has value
afternoon timein has value
afternoon timeout has value
THEN
work_hour = morning timein to morning timeout + afternoon timein to afternoon timeout

CASE 2: halfday morning
morning timein has value
morning timeout has value
afternoon timein has no value
afternoon timeout has no value
THEN
work_hour = morning timein to morning timeout

CASE 3: halfday afternoon
morning timein has no value
morning timeout has no value
afternoon timein has value
afternoon timeout has value
THEN
work_hour = afternoon timein to afternoon timeout

CASE 4: no timein morning
THEN
CASE 3 or halfday afternoon computation will be applied
IF timein is supplied then CASE 1 or wholeday computation will be applied

CASE 5: no timeout morning
THEN
CASE 3 or halfday afternoon computation will be applied
IF timeout is supplied then CASE 1 or wholeday computation will be applied

CASE 6: no timein afternoon
THEN
CASE 2 or halfday morning computation will be applied
IF timein is supplied then CASE 1 or wholeday computation will be applied

CASE 7: no timeout afternoon
THEN
CASE 2 or halfday morning computation will be applied
IF timeout is supplied then CASE 1 or wholeday computation will be applied

CASE 8: morning timein only
THEN
It will be assumed the morning timein is the only log of the day
work_hour will be computed from morning timein up to midnight
For example:
morning timein = 10:00:00 AM
work_hour = 14:00:00 Hours (10:00:00 AM to Midnight)

CASE 9: afternoon timein only
THEN
It will be assumed the afternoon timein is the only log of the day
work_hour will be computed from afternoon timein up to midnight
For example:
afternoon timein = 01:00:00 PM
work_hour = 11:00:00 Hours (01:00:00 PM to Midnight)

CASE 10: morning timeout only
THEN
It will be assumed the morning timeout is the only log of the day
work_hour will be computed from midnight up to morning timeout
For example:
morning timeout = 12:00:00 PM
work_hour = 12:00:00 Hours (Midnight up to 12:00:00 PM)

CASE 11: afternoon timeout only
THEN
It will be assumed the afternoon timeout is the only log of the day
work_hour will be computed from midnight up to afternoon timeout
For example:
afternoon timeout = 05:00:00 PM
work_hour = 17:00:00 Hours (Midnight up to 05:00:00 PM)

NOTE:
CASE 8,9,10,11 will be applied for shifts that span 2 days
For example:
On Monday a staff logins at night then logouts on Tuesday morning
